# ABOUT-SECTION
about-description:
- p: "This site has gone through dozens of iterations in the 15+ years that I've owned this domain. At first it was the home of a musical project I worked on as a teenager, but as priorities shifted it became my professional homebase. Each time I introduce a new version of this site I hope to leverage new practices and technologies to ensure a modern experience across devices."
- p: "Right now, this static single-page site was generated using GitHub's Jekyll tool. Markup templating is done through the Liquid template engine and fed with YAML front-matter. Styles were written using the SASS preprocessor. This site's code is housed in this GitHub repository."
