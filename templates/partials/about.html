  <p>This site has gone through dozens of iterations in the 10+ years that I've owned this domain. At first it was the home of a musical project I worked on, but as priorities shifted, it became my professional homebase. Each time I introduce a new version of this site I hope to leverage new practices and technologies to ensure a modern experience across devices.</p>
  <p>Right now, this static single-page site was generated using the <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>-powered <a href="https://github.com/Snugug/gulp-armadillo" title="Armadillo static site generator">Armadillo</a> generator. Markup was created with the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> templating language and fed with <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> front matter. Styles were written with the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> preprocessor. This site's code is housed in <a href="https://github.com/gvorbeck/iamgarrett-static">this</a> GitHub repository and is built by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>.
